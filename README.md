### TODO

- Should the cloudinary object be in a store?
- Extract constants and put them in a sensible place
- Try having all the index page banners work like the Artifacts is at the moment to see if that speeds things up? This way has it fetching every time, which seems bad, but it also doesn't flash. Maybe there's a better way. Probably.
