		<h1>Welcome</h1>

		<p>Hey check it out. We have a site!</p>

		<p>Look around and see what's here. Not much yet. But think of the possibilities!</p>

		<h2>How you can help</h2>

		<h3>Add Content</h3>

		<p>
			Even if it's just a name and a quick description of your favorite NPC, anything is a start.
			You can also upload images. Each item can have multiple, so it's perfectly fine if we have the
			official representation (Noel's drawing from Roll20) alongside others you all find or create.
		</p>

		<h3>Design Help</h3>

		<p>
			Style — Come up with a color scheme. Find a cool font. Design a page's layout. Find a better
			banner for a page. Make a suggestion. Report a bug. Don't be shy. We can try anything and can
			always change things.
		</p>

		<p>
			Content — Suggest a new page or a new feature. The pages are currently pretty bare. Most
			things just have a name, description, and markdownNotes area. Most should have more. For
			instance, a Place might have a population, a type (is it a planet a town or what?), common
			races, associations, etc. Let's think it through and I'll make it happen!
		</p>

		<p>
			The best way to make a suggestion is to start a discussion or create an issue on <a
				href="https://github.com/scottBowles/airel-client/discussions"
				rel="external noopener noreferrer"
				target="_blank">GitHub<span class="gh-icon"><DiGithubBadge /></span></a
			> (you'll have to make an account but that's simple enough). There anyone who wants can discuss
			and track progress made. You can also see and help with some things I have in mind already (mostly
			under the Issues tab at the moment). Feel free to comment on anything.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're really feeling into it and want to learn, you're also welcome to help with the code.
			But that's beyond the scope of this page and I don't expect many takers.
		</p>

		<p>Enjoy! I'm looking forward to seeing what this space can be!</p>
